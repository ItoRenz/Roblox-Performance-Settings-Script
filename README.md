### Quality Preset Details

| Preset | Render Distance | Shadows | Particles | Post-Processing | Best For |
|--------|----------------|---------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Low** | 250 studs | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Low-end devices, maximum FPS |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize the script by modifying the `QUALITY_PRESETS` table:

```lua
local QUALITY_PRESETS = {
    CustomQuality = {
        renderDistance = 1000,      -- Camera max zoom distance
        shadowsEnabled = true,       -- Global shadows on/off
        particlesEnabled = true,     -- Particle emitters on/off
        postProcessing = false,      -- Post effects on/off
        fogEnabled = false,          -- Distance fog on/off
        brightness = 2,              -- Lighting brightness (1-3)
        technology = Enum.Technology.ShadowMap,
        castShadow = true,           -- Per-part shadows
        reflectance = 0.3,           -- Material reflectance (0-1)
        -- ... other settings
    }
}
```

### Customizing Colors
Modify the `COLORS` table to change button colors:

```lua
local COLORS = {
    Low = Color3.fromRGB(255, 100, 100),
    Medium = Color3.fromRGB(255, 180, 60),
    High = Color3.fromRGB(100, 200, 100),
    Cinematic = Color3.fromRGB(138, 43, 226)
}
```

### Changing Hotkey (Desktop)
Find this line and change `Enum.KeyCode.G` to your preferred key:

```lua
if input.KeyCode == Enum.KeyCode.G then
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### System Requirements
- **Roblox Studio** version 2019 or later
- **FilteringEnabled** must be enabled
- **LocalScript** execution in `StarterPlayerScripts`

### Services Used
- `Players` - Player management
- `RunService` - FPS calculation
- `UserInputService` - Input detection
- `Lighting` - Visual effects
- `Workspace` - Object manipulation

### Performance Impact
- **Low overhead** - Minimal impact on game performance
- **Optimized loops** - Batch processing prevents lag spikes
- **Event debouncing** - Prevents excessive function calls
- **Smart caching** - Reduces redundant operations

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Settings not applying:**
- Ensure the script is in `StarterPlayer` ‚Üí `StarterPlayerScripts`
- Check that it's a `LocalScript`, not a regular Script
